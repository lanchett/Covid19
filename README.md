# Covid-19 Analysis

This script fetches data containing information about Covid-19, per country. 

Furthermore, it saves a csv-file that has the format to be used with [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/), to make animated bar chart races. Just create an account, choose the bar chart race template, and update this csv. 
[Here is the one I've created](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/1599375/)


I've also started making a bar char race in R in the end of the script. 
This still has some work left.
